## Bustabit
Bustabit is an online gambling game that is based on blockchain technology. It is a social gambling game that allows players to bet on the outcome of a pseudo-random number generator, which determines a multiplier that increases rapidly as the game progresses. The objective is to "cash out" or withdraw your bet before the multiplier crashes, and the game ends.

### Here's how the game works:

- Players place their bets in Bitcoin (or other supported cryptocurrencies) before the round begins.
- A multiplier starts at 1x and increases as time progresses.
- Players can cash out at any time by clicking the "cash out" button. The goal is to cash out before the multiplier crashes.
- If a player cashes out before the crash, they win their bet multiplied by the value of the multiplier at the time of cashing out. If the player does not   cash out before the crash, they lose their bet.
- After the crash, a new round begins, and players can place their bets again.

The game has a social aspect, as players can see the bets and cash-out points of other players in real-time. This can create a sense of competition and camaraderie among players. It is important to note that Bustabit and other similar games can be highly addictive, and it is crucial to play responsibly and be aware of the risks associated with gambling.
